# python-training-projects

This repository is a backup loaction I am using to store created training projects I have developed in the python programming language.
I watch training vids and read from some books, then I practice what I reviewed. I'm a slow learner so I go back and re-work some of the same
concepts over and over again to reinforce the lessons. I store my projects on my own drive, but this is a great space to back it up, and if reviewed by
others with more experiece than I, I'm open to constructive criticism or feedback from the pros. Feedback is appreciated.
